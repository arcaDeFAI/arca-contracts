You must write/update a handoff document called BRIEF.md.

The `BRIEF.md` file is a **working document** that tracks current project status and provides practical instructions for continuing work. It should be updated after major work sessions.

### How to Update BRIEF.md
1. **Update Status Section** - Current progress, what's working vs broken
2. **Revise Work Plan** - Move completed items to "Working", add new blockers to "Needs Work"
3. **Update Time Estimates** - Based on actual work completed
4. **Add New Patterns/Instructions** - If you discover better ways to do things

### BRIEF.md Principles
- **Honest Assessment** - What actually works vs what needs work
- **Clear Instructions** - Specific patterns, commands, file locations
- **Practical Focus** - Enable someone to pick up and continue work
- **No Celebration** - Facts about status, not achievements


Keep BRIEF.md as the **single source of truth** for project status and next actions.

You may ask yourself: what would I wish I knew if I had to work on this next?
