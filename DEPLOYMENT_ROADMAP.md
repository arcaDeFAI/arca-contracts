# Arca Vault System - Deployment Roadmap

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The Arca vault system is a decentralized vault for automated liquidity provision on the Sonic blockchain. It provides intelligent vault management for Metropolis DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) pools with automated reward compounding and yield optimization.

### Core Architecture
- **ArcaTestnetV1**: Main vault contract handling deposits, withdrawals, and liquidity management
- **ArcaQueueHandlerV1**: Manages deposit/withdrawal queues for batched processing
- **ArcaRewardClaimerV1**: Handles METRO reward claiming and automatic compounding
- **ArcaFeeManagerV1**: Manages fee configuration and collection (0.5% deposit/withdraw, 10% performance)

All contracts use **OpenZeppelin's UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern** for future upgrades.

## âœ… COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Project Setup âœ…
- [x] Hardhat configuration with TypeScript
- [x] OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin integration
- [x] Dependencies and submodules (Joe V2)
- [x] Development environment setup

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development âœ…
- [x] Core vault contracts with UUPS proxy pattern
- [x] Queue-based deposit/withdrawal system
- [x] Dual token share tracking (TokenX/TokenY)
- [x] METRO reward claiming and compounding
- [x] Fee management system
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance âœ…
- [x] **151/151 tests passing (100% success)**
- [x] Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- [x] Unit tests for all contract functions
- [x] Integration tests for full workflow
- [x] Precise value testing (no vague assertions)
- [x] Production bug discovery and fixes via TDD
- [x] Edge case coverage and error handling

#### Critical Bugs Fixed Through TDD:
- Division by zero in `getPricePerFullShare` when `tokenBalance == 0` but `totalSupply > 0`
- Division by zero in withdrawal processing when `totalShares[tokenIdx] == 0`
- Performance fee collection consistency (now collected on all rewards regardless of swap threshold)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Considerations

### Deployment Challenges
1. **Contract Size Limits**: Avoid factory contracts that exceed 24.5KB limit
2. **UUPS Proxy Complexity**: Proper initialization and upgrade authorization
3. **Inter-Contract Dependencies**: Contracts must reference each other correctly
4. **Ownership Transfer**: Complex ownership flow during deployment

### Key Requirements
- All contracts must use UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern
- Supporting contracts (QueueHandler, FeeManager, RewardClaimer) owned by main vault
- Proper fee recipient configuration
- Secure upgrade authorization (owner-only)

### Success Metrics
- All contracts deployed and verified successfully
- All ownership transfers completed correctly
- All integration tests pass on deployed contracts
- Frontend can interact with deployed contracts
- Production monitoring shows healthy system state

### Current Infrastructure
- Deployment scripts: `/scripts/deployArcaSystem.ts`
- Ignition modules: `/ignition/modules/`
- Test infrastructure: `/test/` (151 tests, 100% passing)
- Configuration: `hardhat.config.ts`

## ðŸš€ Next Immediate Action

**Start with Phase 4.1**: Create Hardhat Ignition deployment modules for the UUPS proxy system.

This involves:
1. Analyzing existing deployment infrastructure in `/scripts/` and `/ignition/`
2. Creating comprehensive Ignition modules for all contracts
3. Handling the complex initialization parameter flow
4. Testing deployment process on local network
